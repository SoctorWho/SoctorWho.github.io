Watch The Rise of the Cybermen with us on our Discord Server, 15 years to the minute (Prompt start at 7:00pm) after its first broadcast.

The Tardis crash-lands on Earth in what at first seems to be the present. But the skies are filled with airships, and the docile citizens suffer regular downloads of information into their brains. This parallel world is ruled by crazed megalomaniac John Lumic (played with relish by Roger Lloyd Pack), a sinister Dr Strangelove-type figure whose henchmen load London's homeless people into vans to deliver them to an unimaginable fate.
Gripping though all this is, the real interest of tonight's episode is the return of the Doctor's old foes, the Cybermen. There's a big build-up to their first appearance, and you can hear their terrifying footsteps long before they stomp into view in all their tinny majesty.
Time has moved on, of course, and they look very different from how they did in the old days. If anything, they're more scary, and there's genuine dread as they clump, clump, clump towards the Doctor and Rose (David Tennant and Billie Piper), ready to take over the world.
