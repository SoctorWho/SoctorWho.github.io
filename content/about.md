We are Soctor Who, a Doctor Who society yet to be affilliated to University of Nottingham Student's Union. We were founded in March 2021.

Our constitution can be found [here](https://github.com/Soctor-Who/constitution/releases/latest/download/constitution.pdf), and changes to it can be proposed at our AGMs or EGMs.

Our events are bound by our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) which ensures that all people are welcome at our events.
