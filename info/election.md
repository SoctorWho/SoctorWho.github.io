As per the Student Union's regulation, our elections are run by [Single Transferrable Vote (STV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) at either an AGM or EGM (annual or extraordinary general meeting). The AGM is normally run at the end of summer term, but may be at any time of year. The AGM will be publicised in advance.
