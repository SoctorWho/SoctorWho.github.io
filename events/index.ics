DESCRIPTION:Watch Army of Ghosts with us on our Discord Server, 15 years to the minute (Prompt start at 7:00pm) after its first broadcast.
There&rsquo;s a hole in the fabric of reality, allowing the Doctor&rsquo;s old foes, the Cybermen, to return to Earth en masse. Don&rsquo;t you just hate it when that happens? Actually, this is a thrillingly exciting episode, the penultimate of the series and the first of a two-part finale that sees the Doctor (David Tennant) and Rose (Billie Piper) facing their greatest ever battle. The pair land on Earth for a visit to Rose&rsquo;s mum Jackie (Camille Coduri), who&rsquo;s eagerly anticipating the arrival of her dad. But, as Rose gently points out, he died some years ago. So who is the mysterious visitor? Well, he&rsquo;s a ghost and he has an awful lot of ghostly friends, who pop down to Earth for brief appearances, courtesy of the mysterious Torchwood Institute and its sharp boss (Tracy-Ann Oberman). But the ghosts aren&rsquo;t the friendly figures they at first seem - and also far from friendly are the contents of a mysterious, glowing sphere&hellip; (Alison Graham TV editor) More details can be found at <no value>https://soctorwh.ooo/events/watch-along/s28-15th-anniv/12-army-of-ghosts/

SUMMARY:Rise of the Cybermen
DESCRIPTION:Watch The Rise of the Cybermen with us on our Discord Server, 15 years to the minute (Prompt start at 7:00pm) after its first broadcast.
The Tardis crash-lands on Earth in what at first seems to be the present. But the skies are filled with airships, and the docile citizens suffer regular downloads of information into their brains. This parallel world is ruled by crazed megalomaniac John Lumic (played with relish by Roger Lloyd Pack), a sinister Dr Strangelove-type figure whose henchmen load London&rsquo;s homeless people into vans to deliver them to an unimaginable fate. Gripping though all this is, the real interest of tonight&rsquo;s episode is the return of the Doctor&rsquo;s old foes, the Cybermen. There&rsquo;s a big build-up to their first appearance, and you can hear their terrifying footsteps long before they stomp into view in all their tinny majesty. Time has moved on, of course, and they look very different from how they did in the old days. If anything, they&rsquo;re more scary, and there&rsquo;s genuine dread as they clump, clump, clump towards the Doctor and Rose (David Tennant and Billie Piper), ready to take over the world.
