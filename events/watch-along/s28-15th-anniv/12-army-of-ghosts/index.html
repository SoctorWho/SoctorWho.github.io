Don&rsquo;t you just hate it when that happens? Actually, this is a thrillingly exciting episode, the penultimate of the series and the first of a two-part finale that sees the Doctor (David Tennant) and Rose (Billie Piper) facing their greatest ever battle.
The pair land on Earth for a visit to Rose&rsquo;s mum Jackie (Camille Coduri), who&rsquo;s eagerly anticipating the arrival of her dad. But, as Rose gently points out, he died some years ago. So who is the mysterious visitor? Well, he&rsquo;s a ghost and he has an awful lot of ghostly friends, who pop down to Earth for brief appearances, courtesy of the mysterious Torchwood Institute and its sharp boss (Tracy-Ann Oberman).
